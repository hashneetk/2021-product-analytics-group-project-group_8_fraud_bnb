## Goal: 
The goal of this project is to design an algorithm to assign a reliability score to the listings on vacation rental websites to help prevent fraudulent bookings which costs the industry $400M annually. The ML algorithm that has been created is based on the descriptive statistical analysis and text processing.

We created a full-stack solution from front-end to the database and ML model. Different tools and technologies used are Docker, AWS(S3,EC2 and Beanstalk), Flask, Python, Javascript and Bootstrap.
